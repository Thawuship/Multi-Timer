# Multi-Timer

A simple web application that allows users to create, manage, and persist multiple timers with millisecond precision. This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and leverages `localStorage` to ensure that timers persist across page refreshes.

## Features

- Add multiple timers with unique names.
- Start, stop, reset, rename, and delete individual timers.
- Clear all timers at once.
- Millisecond precision for each timer.
- Persistent timers using `localStorage`.
