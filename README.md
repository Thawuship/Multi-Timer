# Multi-Timer

The Multi-Timer web application was built to provide a simple, intuitive way to manage multiple timers simultaneously. This project was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring compatibility with modern web browsers. The core idea was to allow users to create timers with unique names, start, stop, reset, rename, and delete them, while also ensuring that the timers persist across page refreshes using `localStorage`.

The development process began with structuring the basic HTML layout, including a table to display the timers and buttons for user interactions. CSS was then applied to enhance the visual aesthetics, making the interface user-friendly and visually appealing with a clean and modern design. Font Awesome icons were integrated to replace text on buttons, providing a more intuitive user experience.

JavaScript was used to implement the core functionality. This included functions to handle the creation of timers, starting and stopping them, resetting the time, renaming, and deleting individual timers. Special attention was given to ensuring that only one timer runs at a time, stopping all others when a new timer is started. The use of `localStorage` was crucial for storing timer data, allowing users to refresh the page without losing their timers.

Finally, a "Clear All" button was added to provide users with an easy way to reset the application, removing all timers and clearing the `localStorage`. The project was then tested across different browsers to ensure consistent performance and functionality.

## Features
